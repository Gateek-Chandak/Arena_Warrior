# Arena_Warrior
This is a game based on a popular game I love "Super Smash Bros", however with a twist!
I experimented with a lot of different things in this game. 
The main features I implemented were player-seeking enemies, including an enemy class that shoots at the player directly.
I also created different enemy classes.
However, one of the main features I implemented was a triple jump mechanic using  physics and mathematics with gravity and friction.
